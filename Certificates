# Introduction

As an administrator, ensuring secure network communication is crucial. One way to achieve this is through secure certificates. CA-signed certificates, issued by trusted third parties, offer high security but can be costly and sometimes unnecessary. In these cases, a self-signed public certificate is a cost-effective and convenient alternative.

Self-signed certificates are ideal for testing and provide a secure solution for administrators needing certificate-based security. With just a single PowerShell cmdlet, you can create an SSL certificate that meets your needs.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on creating certificates for various purposes, simplifying the process for administrators.

Creating your own SSL certificate is straightforward. With the New-SelfSignedCertificate cmdlet, you can quickly generate a self-signed certificate.

```powershell
$Certificate = New-SelfSignedCertificate â€“Subject Contoso.com -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My 
```
